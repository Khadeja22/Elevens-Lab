This GitHub repository contains a Java implementation of a Card class and a Deck class. The Card class allows you to create card objects with ranks, suits, and point values, while the Deck class enables you to create decks of cards for various card games. The project includes fully functional classes with constructors, accessor methods, and a deck-shuffling feature. It's a valuable resource for learning object-oriented programming in Java, and you can explore the completed assignment with detailed code and documentation.
